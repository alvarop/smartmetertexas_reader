This is a work in progress...

smartmetertexas.com provides meter information in 15-minute intervals.
You can download a csv file with all of the data, so I'm writing a script to get some information out of it.

The script currently spits outs csv files which need to be plotted with another program. Eventually, I want to use gnuplots or something similar to automate this.
